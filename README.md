# personal-project-auto-water-pump-Arduino

My project using an Arduino. 

Problem - lots of plants were dying inside the house as the family is busy and no one to look after them. Came up with a solution to create a automatic water pump that pumps water into the soil of an in door plant once moisture levels were detected to be too low.


Brief description- A moisture sensor connects to an Arduino that relays the conductivity of the soil into readable data like numbers. If the number is too low, indicates lower moisture level and hence it will send a signal to an attachable small motor to start pump water into the soil for a desired time amount. Project also takes into account when water tank is empty (no water left). The Arduino also connects to a built circuit that flashes led lights: red light for low moisture levels, white for medium moisture levels and green for great moisture levels. When red light flashes, hopfully water tank can be refilled.
