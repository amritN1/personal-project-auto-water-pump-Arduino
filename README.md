# personal-project-auto-water-pump-Arduino

My project using an Arduino. 

Problem - lots of plants were dying inside the house as the family is busy and no one to look after them. Came up with a solution to create a automatic water pump that pumps water into the soil of an in door plant once moisture levels were detected to be too low.


Brief description- A moisture sensor connects to an Arduino that relays the conductivity of the soil into readable data like numbers. If the number is too low it will send a signal to an attachable small motor to start pump water into the soil for a desired time amount. Project also takes into account when water tank is empty (no water left). The Arduino also connects to a built circuit that flashes led lights: red light for low moisture levels, white for medium moisture levels and green for great moisture levels. When red light flashes, hopfully water tank can be refilled.
